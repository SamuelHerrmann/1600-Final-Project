# Overview

This page is ment to teach you some of the basic syntax included with the Markdown coding language.

# Headings

To make headings simply type "# (your text)". Adding additional #'s will decrease the size of your heading to a maximum of 6 #.

This syntax needs to have an empty line both above and below the line you wish to make a heading.

# Paragraphs and Regular Text

To make paragraphs and regular text simply type in an empty line of code.

# Bold and Italic text

To make a text **bold** simply add "\*\*" or "\_\_" (two underscores in a row) to the beginning and end of the desired text.

To make it *Italic* add "\*" or "\_" (one underscore) to the beginning and end of the desired text.

To make the text ***Bold and Italic*** put "\*\*\*" or "\_\_\_" (three underscores in a row) to the beginning and end of the desired text.

# Links

To make a text have a link attached to it type this "\[text you want to display\]\(link\)"

Alternativly to just make a link functional, add "\<" to the beginning and "\>" to the end.

# Images

To add an image to your Markdown page type this:

"\!\[alt text if image is not in repository\]\(path to image file\)"
