# Overview

This page is ment to teach you some of the basic syntax included with the Markdown coding language.

# Headings

To make headings simply type "# (your text)". Adding additional #'s will decrease the size of your heading to a maximum of 6 #.
This syntax needs to have an empty line both above and below the line you wish to make a heading.

# Paragraphs and Regular Text

To make paragraphs and regular text simply type in an empty line of code.

# Bold and Italic text

To make a text **bold** simply add ** or __ (two underscores in a row) to the beginning and end of the desired text.
To make it *Italic* add * or _ (one underscore) to the beginning and end of the desired text.
To make the text ***Bold and Italic*** put *** or ___ (three underscores in a row) to the beginning and end of the desired text.

# Links

To make a text have a link attached to it type this "[text you want to display] (link)" but remove the space inbetween the two sections.
Alternativly to just make a link functional, add < to the beginning and > to the end
